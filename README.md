### General Idea

- the algorithm uses fractals to draw tree like structures in random positions and orientations with lerp colors between all of the spectre of the RGB pallete.


#Branch.pde 
constains the class for the branch of the tree structure.
##Fist_generative_art_assignment.pde
contains the main algorithm that visualizes the branch class and controls theyre orientation and position on the canvas.
